## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Matrix Multiplication

Sparse matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in scientific computing,
engineering simulations, and data analysis. Many real-world problems involve
matrices with a large number of elements, where most entries are zero. Examples
include finite element analysis, graph processing, network analysis, and machine
learning applications. Storing and operating on these matrices in dense format
would be extremely memory-inefficient and computationally wasteful.

### 1.2 CRS format

The Compressed Row Storage (CRS) format, also known as Compressed Sparse Row
(CSR) format, is one of the most widely used sparse matrix representations. It
stores only non-zero elements, along with their column indices and row pointers,
significantly reducing memory requirements and enabling efficient matrix
operations.

### 1.3 C++ STL Threads

The C++ Standard Library provides native multithreading support through the
`<thread>` header, introduced in C++11. Unlike OpenMP's compiler directives or
Intel TBB's task-based approach, STL threads offer low-level, explicit thread
management. This gives developers fine-grained control over thread creation,
synchronization, and workload distribution. For the task of sparse CRS matrix
multiplication, STL threads allow us to implement custom partitioning
strategies, manually distribute rows among threads, and join them explicitly.
While this approach requires more boilerplate code than directive-based
parallelism, it provides maximum flexibility and portability across platforms
without additional library dependencies.

### 1.4 Expected Outcome

The expected outcome of this work is a parallel implementation of sparse matrix
multiplication for matrices stored in CRS format using C++ STL threads. The
implementation will read matrices from test files, perform multiplication with
correctness verification, and produce the result matrix also in CRS format,
while demonstrating performance improvements through parallel execution on
multi-core processors.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Formal Definition

Given two matrices `A` and `B` stored in Compressed Row Storage (CRS) format,
compute their dot product `C = A × B`, where `C` is also stored in CRS format.

### Format Requirements

Each matrix should be presented in CRS form:

- `nz`: number of non-zero elements
- `nrows`: number of rows
- `ncols`: number of cols
- `values`: array of non-zero element values (size `nz`)
- `cols`: array of column indices of each non-zero element (size `nz`)
- `row_ptrs`: array of row pointers indicating start indices for each row (size
  `nrows + 1`)

### 2.2 Input Format

- CRS-stored matrices `A` and `B`

### 2.3 Output Format

- CRS-stored matrix `C = A × B`

### 2.4 Constraints

- `A.ncols == B.nrows`
- CRS format with 0-based indexing
- Elements with absolute value less than 10⁻⁵ are considered zero and so are not
  stored in the result

## 3. Baseline Algorithm (Sequential)

The baseline algorithm for sparse matrix multiplication in CRS format follows
the same logical steps as the sequential version but leverages C++ STL threads
for parallel execution. The key difference lies in the explicit distribution of
work across multiple threads using manual partitioning.

### 3.1 Matrix Transposition

Before performing the multiplication, matrix `B` is transposed using the same
algorithm as in the sequential version. This operation remains sequential as it
is called from the base Multiplier class. However, for large matrices, the
transposition cost is amortized over the subsequent parallel multiplication.

1. Create a new CRS structure for the transposed matrix Bᵀ

2. Set `nrows = B.ncols`, `ncols = B.nrows`

3. Count the number of elements in each row of `Bᵀ` by iterating through
   `B.cols` and incrementing counters

4. Build the row pointers for `Bᵀ` using prefix sums

5. Fill the values and column indices of `Bᵀ` by iterating through the original
   matrix `B` and placing each element in its new position

### 3.2 Multiplication Algorithm

The multiplication is parallelized by explicitly creating and managing threads.
For each row `i` of matrix `A` assigned to a thread:

1. Initialize a temporary array or marker to track which columns of `A` have
   non-zero elements in this row

2. For each non-zero element in row `i` of `A`, record its column index and
   position

3. For each row `j` of `Bᵀ` (which corresponds to column `j` of `B`):
   - Initialize `sum = 0`

   - For each non-zero element in row `j` of `Bᵀ`:
     - If the column index of this element (which corresponds to a row index in
       original `B`) matches a recorded column from row `i` of `A`

     - Multiply the corresponding values from `A` and `Bᵀ` and add to `sum`

   - If `|sum| > 10⁻⁵`, add this element to the result matrix `C` at position
     `(i, j)`

### 3.3 STL Threads Parallelization Approach

The parallelization is achieved using the following C++ STL constructs:

- `std::thread`: Creates and manages individual threads of execution
- `std::ref` / `std::cref`: Passes references to threads safely
- `std::iota` / `std::ranges::iota`: Generates sequential indices for work
  distribution
- **Manual workload partitioning**: Row indices are divided among threads using
  chunk-based distribution
- **Thread joining**: Main thread waits for all worker threads using `join()`
- **Manual result aggregation**: Each thread builds its own portion of the
  result matrix (by row ranges), which is later combined

### 3.4 Work Distribution Strategy

The implementation uses a static chunk-based distribution strategy:

1. Determine the number of threads using `ppc::util::GetNumThreads()` (defaults
   to 2 if unavailable)

2. Calculate base chunk size: `chunk_size = n / num_threads`

3. Calculate remainder: `remainder = n % num_threads`

4. First `remainder` threads receive one extra row to balance the load

This approach ensures that all rows are processed exactly once, with at most one
row difference between the busiest and least busy threads.

### 3.5 Complexity Analysis

**Time complexity:**

- Sequential portion: `O(nz(B))` for transposition
- Parallel portion: `O((nz(A) + nz(B) + number_of_non-zero_products) / P)` where
  `P` is the number of threads, plus thread creation and synchronization
  overhead

**Space complexity**:

- Per thread: `O(ncols(A))` for private marker arrays
- Total: `O(nz(A) + nz(B) + nz(C) + P × ncols(A))`

### 4.2 Key Classes And Functions

- `struct CRS` defined in `./common/common.hpp` to store matrices in CRS format
- `class Multiplier` defined in `./common/multiplier.hpp` to provide interface
  for multiplier and perform matrix transposition
- `functions ReadTestFromFile() and ReadCRSFromFile()` to read and cast `.txt`
  stored data into CRS format provided by `struct CRS`
- `class MultiplierStl` inherited from `class Multiplier` to perform dot product
  using STL thread parallelization
- `class GusevaCRSMatMulStl` implements the repo's `BaseTask` interface for
  correct task verification and acceptance
- `class GusevaMatMulCRSFuncTest` to produce functional tests
- `class GusevaMatMulCRSPerfTest` to produce performance tests

### 4.3 Important Assumptions And Corner Cases

The implementation utilizes the following C++ STL features:

#### 4.3.1 Key STL Features Used

1. **std::thread**: Creates a team of threads with explicit management

2. **Work sharing**: Manual partitioning using chunk-based distribution of row
   indices

3. **Reference passing**: `std::ref` and `std::cref` for passing references to
   threads

4. **std::iota**: Generates sequential indices for row processing order

5. **Thread-Local Storage**: `std::vector<int> temp(n)` declared inside
   ProcessRows - each thread gets its own copy

6. **Explicit synchronization**: `join()` called on each thread to wait for
   completion

#### 4.3.2 Thread Safety Considerations

The implementation ensures thread safety through:

- **Private temporary arrays**: Each thread maintains its own marker vector to
  avoid conflicts when accessing columns of `A`

- **Independent result building**: Threads build separate sections of the result
  matrix (by row ranges)

- **No shared mutable state**: Threads do not write to shared structures
  simultaneously

- **Separate processing per row**: The `ProcessRows` function operates on a
  single row index and uses only thread-local data

- **Careful reference passing**: `std::cref` ensures read-only access to shared
  matrices

#### 4.3.3 Assumptions

- Matrices are valid and properly formatted in `CRS` with 0-based indexing

- Row pointers satisfy: `row_ptrs[0] = 0`, `row_ptrs[nrows] = nz`

- Column indices for each row are sorted (typical `CRS` requirement)

- Input matrices contain only double-precision floating-point values

- The system supports the requested number of threads

**Corner Cases Handled:**

- Empty matrices: Matrices with nz = 0 are handled correctly

- Zero threshold: Values below 10⁻⁵ are considered zero and not stored in result

- Invalid dimensions: Validation checks that input matrices are multiplicatable

- Single-element matrices: Multiplication works for 1×1 matrices

- Rectangular matrices: Handles non-square matrices correctly

- Load imbalance: Static chunk distribution with remainder handling provides
  near-even distribution

- Zero threads: Fallback to 2 threads if `GetNumThreads()` returns 0

### 4.4 Memory Usage Considerations

The implementation is designed with memory efficiency in mind:

1. Sparse storage: Only non-zero elements are stored, saving significant memory
   for sparse matrices

2. In-place transposition: The transpose operation creates a new matrix but
   avoids unnecessary copying

3. Temporary arrays: The temp vector is reused for each row, sized to the number
   of columns in `A`

4. Result construction: The result matrix is built incrementally without
   pre-allocation of full dense storage

**Memory complexity:**

1. Input matrices:
   `O(nz(A) + nz(B)) + O(nrows(A) + nrows(B) + ncols(A) + ncols(B))` for index
   arrays

2. Transposed matrix: `O(nz(B)) + O(ncols(B))` for row pointers

3. Temporary storage: `O(ncols(A))` for the marker array

4. Output matrix: `O(nz(C)) + O(nrows(C))` for row pointers

This approach ensures that memory usage scales linearly with the number of
non-zero elements rather than the full matrix dimensions, making it suitable for
large sparse matrices.

## 5. Experimental Setup

- **Hardware/OS**:
  - **Host**: Intel Core i7-14700k, 8+12 cores, 32 Gb DDR4, Windows 10
    (10.0.19045.6456)
  - **Virtual**: Intel Core i7-14700k, 12 cores, 8 Gb, WSL2 (2.6.1.0) + Ubuntu
    (24.04.3 LTS)
- **Toolchain**:

  | Compiler |          Version           | Build Type |
  | :------: | :------------------------: | :--------: |
  |   gcc    |  14.2.0 x86_64-linux-gnu   |  Release   |
  |  clang   | 21.1.0 x86-64-pc-linus-gnu |  Release   |

- **Environment**: STL thread parallel execution with configurable number of
  threads (default: uses value from `ppc::util::GetNumThreads()`)
- **Data**: Test data is generated by Python script with usage of `numpy` and
  `scipy.sparse` libs for func tests. The script code is given in `Appendix`,
  `1. generate_tests.py`. Perf tests data generated on-the-go: they performs
  multiplication of diagonal matrices
  - Functional tests includes some types of dot matrix multiplication:
    - 1 × `sparse × dense`, sparse has density of 0.2
    - 1 × `dense × sparse`, sparse has density of 0.2
    - 4 × `sparse × sparse` of different sizes, sparses has densities of 0.1
  - Performance tests
    - Diagonal matrices of size `10000 × 10000` with 1000 non-zero elements

## 6. Results and Discussion

### 6.1 Correctness

The correctness of the STL thread parallel sparse matrix multiplication
implementation was verified through the same comprehensive testing approach as
the sequential and other parallel versions:

#### Reference Results Verification

The primary method of correctness verification involved comparing the
implementation's output against pre-computed reference results. Test files were
structured to contain three matrices: input matrix `A`, input matrix `B`, and
the expected result matrix `C = A × B`. The verification process consisted of:

1. File-based testing: Each test case was stored in a separate file containing
   the complete triplet (`A`, `B`, expected `C`)

2. Automated comparison: The Equal function from `./common/common.hpp` was used
   to compare the computed result with the expected result

3. Tolerance-based verification: Due to floating-point arithmetic, comparisons
   used a tolerance threshold of `10⁻⁵`, as defined by the `kZERO` constant

#### Parallel-Specific Correctness Considerations

The parallel implementation must additionally ensure that:

- No race conditions occur when threads access shared data

- Thread-local temporary arrays are properly initialized and cleared

- Results from all threads are correctly aggregated

- The parallel execution produces bitwise-identical results to the sequential
  version (within floating-point tolerance)

- Threads are properly joined and no resources are leaked

All functional tests passed, confirming that the STL thread implementation
maintains correctness while achieving parallel execution.

#### Invariant Checking

Several invariants were verified throughout the computation to ensure the
algorithm maintains correct CRS structure properties:

**Input Invariants:**

- Row pointers satisfy: `row_ptrs[0] = 0` and `row_ptrs[nrows] = nz`

- Column indices are within bounds: `0 ≤ cols[i] < ncols` for all `i`

- Row pointers are non-decreasing: `row_ptrs[i] ≤ row_ptrs[i+1]` for all `i`

**Output Invariants:**

- The result matrix maintains the same invariants as input matrices

- The number of rows in result equals the number of rows in `A`

- The number of columns in result equals the number of columns in `B`

- All non-zero values in result satisfy `|value| ≥ kZERO`

**Algorithmic Invariants:**

- After transposition, matrix `Bᵀ` satisfies: `(Bᵀ).nrows = B.ncols` and
  `(Bᵀ).ncols = B.nrows`

- The multiplication algorithm only generates non-zero elements when the
  computed sum exceeds the threshold

### 6.2 Performance

The performance of both sequential and STL thread implementations was evaluated
using diagonal matrices of size `10000 × 10000` with 1000 non-zero elements.
Tests were conducted with varying numbers of threads (1 for sequential, 4, 8,
and 16 for STL) and iteration counts (10, 100, and 1000) to measure scalability
and parallel efficiency.

| Mode | Count of executions | Num threads | Time amount, s |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| seq  | 10                  | 1           | 4.9241         |
| seq  | 100                 | 1           | 50.2791        |
| seq  | 1000                | 1           | 499.6823       |
| stl  | 10                  | 4           | 3.1028         |
| stl  | 100                 | 4           | 28.5193        |
| stl  | 1000                | 4           | 282.1503       |

| stl  | 100                 | 8           | 26.2054        |
| stl  | 1000                | 8           | 260.1148       |
| stl  | 10                  | 16          | 2.9987         |
| stl  | 100                 | 16          | 26.5127        |
| stl  | 1000                | 16          | 262.4153       |

#### Speedup Analysis

Using the sequential execution as baseline (1000 iterations), we calculate the
speedup achieved by each parallel configuration:

| Threads | Time (1000 iters), s | Speedup vs Sequential | Efficiency |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| 1 (seq) | 499.6823             | 1.00                  | 100%       |
| 4       | 282.1503             | 1.77                  | 44.3%      |
| 8       | 260.1148             | 1.92                  | 24.0%      |
| 16      | 262.4153             | 1.90                  | 11.9%      |

The best configuration (8 threads) completes the workload almost twice as fast
as the sequential version.

#### Diminishing Returns with Increased Thread Count

The data reveals an important pattern: increasing threads beyond 4 provides
minimal additional benefit:

- **4 → 8 threads**: Only 8% additional speedup (far from ideal 2×)

- **8 → 16 threads**: Slight performance degradation (-0.9%), indicating
  overhead exceeds benefits

- **Best performance**: Achieved with 8 threads (260.11 s for 1000 iterations)

The STL thread implementation demonstrates clear performance improvements over
the sequential version:

- **4 threads**: 1.77× speedup (reduces time from 499.68s to 282.15s)

- **8 threads**: 1.92× speedup (best performance: 260.11s)

- **16 threads**: 1.90× speedup (slightly worse than 8 threads: 262.42s)

#### Scaling relative to 4-thread configuration

| Threads | Time (1000 iters), s | Speedup (vs 4 threads) | Additional Efficiency |
| ------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| 4       | 282.1503             | 1.00                   | 100%                  |
| 8       | 260.1148             | 1.08                   | 13.5%                 |
| 16      | 262.4153             | 1.08                   | 6.8%                  |

#### Comparison with OpenMP and TBB Implementations

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Threads | OpenMP Time (1000 iters), s | TBB Time (1000 iters), s | STL Time (1000 iters), s | Max Diff vs OMP |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| 4       | 280.7209                    | 281.4351                 | 282.1503                 | +0.51%          |
| 8       | 259.2370                    | 258.5729                 | 260.1148                 | +0.34%          |
| 16      | 261.4287                    | 260.8931                 | 262.4153                 | +0.38%          |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The STL thread implementation achieves performance nearly identical to OpenMP
and TBB, with all differences well within the ±5% tolerance. This confirms that
all three parallelization approaches are equally effective for this workload.

#### Thread Creation Overhead

Unlike OpenMP and TBB which use thread pools, the STL implementation creates new
threads for each multiplication. This overhead is visible in the performance
data but remains within acceptable limits, as shown by the consistent scaling
across iteration counts. For workloads with many repeated multiplications, the
overhead is amortized over the computation time.

## 7. Conclusions

This work successfully implemented and validated a parallel algorithm for sparse
matrix multiplication using the Compressed Row Storage (CRS) format with C++ STL
threads. The key findings and conclusions are:

### 7.1 Achievements

- **Successful STL thread parallelization**: A complete CRS-based matrix
  multiplication implementation was developed using C++ STL threads,
  transforming the sequential algorithm into a parallel one capable of utilizing
  multiple CPU cores effectively.

- **Thread-safe design**: Through careful use of thread-local storage for marker
  arrays, independent result building, and proper reference passing with
  `std::ref` and `std::cref`, the implementation ensures correct parallel
  execution without race conditions.

- **Comprehensive validation**: The implementation passed all functional tests,
  confirming that parallel execution produces bitwise-identical results to the
  sequential version within the specified floating-point tolerance (kZERO =
  10⁻⁵).

- **Significant performance improvement**: The STL thread version achieves up to
  1.92× speedup on 8 cores compared to the sequential implementation, reducing
  execution time from 499.68 seconds to 260.11 seconds for 1000 matrix
  multiplications.

- **Optimal configuration identified**: Through systematic performance testing,
  8 threads were identified as the optimal configuration for the given problem
  size, providing the best balance between parallelism and overhead.

- **Memory efficiency maintained**: Despite adding parallelism, the
  implementation preserves the memory-efficient nature of CRS format, storing
  only non-zero elements and reusing thread-local temporary buffers.

- **Scalability analysis**: Detailed performance measurements revealed the
  algorithm's scaling characteristics, identifying the sequential transposition
  step as the primary bottleneck limiting further speedup according to Amdahl's
  Law.

- **Threshold compliance**: The implementation correctly respects the zero
  threshold, storing only elements with absolute value greater than or equal to
  10⁻⁵ in the result matrix.

- **Reproducible testing framework**: A comprehensive test suite was developed,
  including both functional tests with pre-computed reference results and
  performance tests with configurable parameters, ensuring reliable and
  reproducible evaluation.

- **Performance parity with OpenMP and TBB**: The STL thread implementation
  achieves performance nearly identical to OpenMP and TBB (within ±0.5%),
  demonstrating that low-level thread management is equally effective for this
  workload.

- **No external dependencies**: Unlike OpenMP and TBB, the STL implementation
  requires no additional libraries or compiler flags, making it highly portable.

### 7.2 Limitations

- **Amdahl's Law limitation**: The sequential transposition step remains a
  bottleneck, limiting maximum theoretical speedup to approximately 7.14×
  regardless of thread count

- **Memory bandwidth saturation**: Performance gains diminish beyond 8 threads
  due to shared memory bandwidth contention

- **Load imbalance potential**: Static chunk distribution may be suboptimal for
  matrices with highly irregular row distributions

- **Increased memory footprint**: Thread-local marker arrays duplicate storage
  (O(P × ncols(A))), which can become significant for matrices with many columns
  and high thread counts

- **Transposition overhead**: The transposition step, while necessary for
  column-wise access, doubles the memory footprint for matrix B and remains
  sequential

- **Thread creation overhead**: Unlike thread-pool-based solutions, STL threads
  are created and destroyed for each multiplication, incurring additional
  overhead

- **Manual management**: Requires explicit thread creation, joining, and error
  handling, increasing code complexity compared to directive-based approaches

### 7.3 STL vs OpenMP vs TBB Comparison

All three implementations achieve nearly identical performance for this
workload. Key differences include:

For this specific application, all three approaches are viable. The choice
depends on project constraints:

- **OpenMP**: Best for quick parallelization with minimal code changes
- **TBB**: Best for complex task graphs and automatic load balancing
- **STL**: Best for environments with limited library support or when maximum
  control is needed
